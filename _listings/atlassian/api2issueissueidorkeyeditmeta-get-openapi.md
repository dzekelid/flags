  title: Jira Cloud API Get edit issue meta
  description: |-
    Returns the metadata for editing an issue.

    The fields returned by editmeta resource are the ones shown on the issue's Edit screen. Fields hidden from the screen will not be returned unless `overrideScreenSecurity` parameter is set to true.

    If an issue cannot be edited in Jira because of its workflow status (for example the issue is closed), then no fields will be returned, unless `overrideEditableFlag` is set to true.
